# Introduction

Write a catchy door-kicker! Rise of mass incarceration... [@easonMassImprisonmentRuralUrban2017]

As the Prison Industrial Complex has expanded, scholars have examined the relationship between place and imprisonment in terms of places with high rates of reported crime, places with an overwhelming police presence, and the experiences of people in those communities and their relationship with law enforcement and the greater criminal justice system. It has been well documented that people of color, especially Black men, are more likely to become involved with the carceral system in the US [@simesPunishingPlacesGeography2021; @easonMassImprisonmentRuralUrban2017; @pettitMassImprisonmentLife2004; @sharkeyStuckPlaceUrban2013]. Other than race, class is the next predominant factor that has been addressed by previous research; while race and class are inextricably intertwined, class conditions that lead to imprisonment stretch beyond the urban and racial factors usually associated with crime and subjugation [@pettitMassImprisonmentLife2004; @easonMassImprisonmentRuralUrban2017]. The removal of individuals from an already struggling community only contributes to the cycle of instability that leads to crime and harm. These individuals are fathers, workers, caregivers, and other valuable members of their community; ripping them from their families not only impacts those who may have violated the law, but those they leave behind who may have been financially or emotionally dependent on them [@gilmoreGoldenGulagPrisons2007].

By using what is already known about the disparities in crime and punishment to investigate whether imprisonment is a viable solution to the harm caused by crime, questions about the prevention of crime and the reduction of harm can be answered. What are other similarities of places with high imprisonment rates that could be addressed to reduce imprisonment and aid the reintegration of those released back to their communities? While it may be impossible to determine if the shared characteristics of these locations are the *cause* of high rates of imprisonment, the *result*, or both, it is important to assess how these characteristics illuminate a piece of the greater influence of oppressive policies that fuel the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole.

## Prison Gerrymandering

Prison gerrymandering is the practice of counting imprisoned people as residents of the place where they are imprisoned. The US Census defines residence as "where they live and sleep most of the time" [@uscensusbureau2020CensusResidence2018]. However, incarcerated people cannot vote or participate in the community where they are detained, and they often maintain ties to their community of origin and hope to have a future there when they return. The practice of counting these people as part of a community in which they have no role not only boosts representation for people around a prison but siphons resources and representation from their home communities [@benvenisteWhatPrisonGerrymandering2022]. The community conditions of places with high imprisonment rates are viewed as both the cause and the consequence of over-policing and disenfranchisement through the Prison Industrial Complex as it has expanded in the last several decades. As more people are pulled away from their homes and counted in a place that does not value their interests, the barriers to opportunity are reinforced, and the cycle of subjugation continues. If the true purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation, and the hope upon release is to participate in society fully, the interests and opportunities of these individuals should be considered by policymakers who will impact their future opportunities for success.

As of 2021, about a dozen states had ended prison gerrymandering which would impact the redistricting from the 2020 Census [@fensterHowManyStates2021]. Because of the details involved with determining where and how to count these individuals in their home communities, data has been made available about precisely where people in prison are from, and where they intend to return to [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023]. This information is valuable and unique because it provides a link to determine the conditions that both create an environment where people feel the need to imprison larger portions of the population and create nuanced solutions to reduce both the harm that leads to imprisonment and the harm caused by it.

## Mental Health, Crime, and Imprisonment

Mental health care is an important resource to ensure overall health and quality of life [@princeNoHealthMental2007]. The expansion of mental health care in the last few decades has been a response to a dire crisis that has long been ignored and stigmatized, and the benefits of access and awareness of mental health services are obvious to many who have utilized these services [@hortonLaunchingNewMovement2007]. Though access to mental health services is generally regarded as a positive influence on communities, the marginalized groups who often lack access to these services are the same communities that are targeted for high crime and imprisonment rates [@saxenaResourcesMentalHealth2007]. The link between access to mental health care, crime, and imprisonment is worth investigating to advocate for more resources to be made available for these communities and potentially prevent crime and harm before they happen, and as a result, reduce unnecessary imprisonment.

Three major components of mental health care and its relationship with imprisonment have been discussed. The first is mental health care as prevention of criminal and violent behavior [@hodginsConsequencesConductDisorder2005; @petrasDevelopmentalEpidemiologicalCourses2008; @brennanMajorMentalDisorders2000]. Increased access to mental health care, especially on a large scale could lead to an overall reduction in violent and aggressive behavior, which comprises most of the crime residents are most concerned about.

The second component is mental health care for the residents impacted by the loss of a loved one or caretaker to imprisonment. Many people in prison are parents or otherwise supportive to other that they leave behind to serve their sentence [@wangBothSidesBars2022]. The social and economic consequences of mass imprisonment are far-reaching, and the individuals living through those consequences would certainly benefit from a support structure that values their mental health [@hatzenbuehlerCollateralDamageMass2015; @nosratiEconomicDeclineIncarceration2019].

Lastly, prison can have a strong psychological impact on a person, and formerly imprisoned people may bring that trauma back to their communities when they are released. People in prison are more likely to suffer from a mental health issue, both because, untreated, they are more likely to be arrested and because of the trauma endured throughout their sentence [@cloudLifeSupportPublic2014; @quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. The damage of imprisonment on mental health can include family disconnection, loss of autonomy and lack of purpose, and unpredictability [@quandtResearchRoundupIncarceration2021]. Accessibility to mental health care may influence productive reintegration after release from prison.

With the new information about the home locations of imprisoned people, there are a number of relationships to investigate. The obvious demographic and economic factors should be considered and potentially controlled in many analyses. One spatial relationship that could be investigated using this data is the accessibility, in terms of distance, to mental health facilities. While there are many dimensions to the concept of accessibility, distance can be a useful indicator of at least when mental health care options are *not* available. Other dimensions to consider are the capacity of facilities, specific services provided, populations served, payment methods accepted, and outreach or awareness of services available. This analysis focuses on the dimension of physical location and proximity as an indicator of access to mental health care, specifically inpatient care for emergency situations.

# Data Origins and Background

The data for this analysis comes from four different sources combined to create a versatile basis for geographic analysis of imprisonment and its relationship with location. The imprisonment data is from Prison Policy Initiative, a non-profit organization working to "expose the broader harm of mass criminalization" through data and research [@prisonpolicyinitiative]. The demographic data for the same census tracts is publicly available from the US Census Bureau [@CensusBureauData2020]. Information about mental health facilities is available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Though the department provides data about many different aspects of mental health treatment and services, since this analysis is focused on the geography of imprisonment, the *2020 National Directory Of Mental Health Treatment Facilities* contains locations and key characteristics for all facilities in the US [@samhsaNationalDirectoryMental2020]. Finally, the American Community Survey hosts geographic and demographic data at the census tract level that is available publicly. This data was used to map the previous data geographically and perform spatial analysis [@esriACSContextEmergency2020].

## Prison Policy Initiative

The data gathered from the Prison Policy Initiative is cross-sectional data based on data from the 2020 Census and Maryland state data. The data originated as administrative data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and was combined with population data from the Census. The Prison Policy Initiative collected, calculated, and combined this data for public use for various levels of geography for Maryland and eleven other states where prison gerrymandering has been overruled.

Most of this data is from the 2020 Census. The imprisonment rate used the redistricting data from Maryland's law ending prison gerrymandering to count prisoners as residents of their home neighborhoods instead of the location of the prison. The data was compiled using the data from the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services which provided the home addresses of imprisoned people to redistricting officials to report them to the Census so they would be recorded in their home neighborhoods and not the prison's location [@widraWherePeoplePrison2023; @RedistrictingData2020].

The original data had 1475 observations and the following 6 variables: FIPS code 2020, Maryland Census tracts, Number of people in state prison from each Census tract 2020, Census population 2020, Total population 2020, and Imprisonment rate per 100,000. The unit of observation for this analysis is the Census tract.

This data can be used to identify what characteristics are common among places with high imprisonment rates. Combined with demographic data about these locations and the proximity of mental health resources, this data can highlight areas in need of more mental health resources to reduce the harm caused by imprisonment and over-policing.

The original data is available from the Prison Policy Initiative website where the report was published. The census tract data for Maryland was copied into Excel, and the variables were renamed to be more usable in the analysis [@thejusticepolicyinstituteCensusTractAppendix2023]. The Prison Policy Initiative report provides thorough documentation of the data, its origins, and how it was processed. The variables have meaningful names, so there is no need for an official codebook.

The abolition of prison gerrymandering is still ongoing, so this data is only available in limited locations. However, it can be used to shed a light on the issue of prison gerrymandering and identify the common circumstances of places with high imprisonment rates.

## US Census Data

The US Census collects cross-sectional data every ten years and makes it available publicly. Though the Census collects data about many different attributes at the individual and household level, the data for this analysis is aggregated to the census tract level. Four datasets were acquired from the online Census repository [@CensusBureauData2020]. These included the following attributes: Employment (2020) with 1475 observations and 562 variables about employment rates; Geographic Mobility (2020) with 1475 observations and 1122 variables containing general demographic information about the population of each tract along with records of what types of people moved within and from outside the county, state, and country; Median Income (2020) with 1475 observations and 483 variables about the median income in each tract for different demographic groups; and Urban and Rural (2010) with 1406 observations and 9 variables contains the number of households in rural and urban areas.

In combination with the imprisonment data, the census data can show correlations between the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of an area and the rate of imprisonment. As stated earlier, while this may not be enough to prove causation, it does describe the systematic ways that incarceration and the Prison Industrial Complex as a whole impact people of color and low-income communities disproportionately.

The data was originally downloaded from the US Census website as a compressed file with three CSV files [@CensusBureauData2020]. One file contained the data, another file contained the variable descriptions for each coded variable in the data file. The third file contained notes about the data and documentation about the methods used to collect and distribute the data. The US Census is a respected source for basic demographic information about each census tract. This is important to determine disparities in different areas that are linked to racial and socioeconomic status.

## Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

Within the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration collects and provides data about a wide array of treatments, services, and facilities for mental health and substance abuse [@samhsaSubstanceAbuseMental]. The data used for this specific analysis contains geographic and key characteristics of mental health facilities in Maryland. While some of these facilities also provide substance abuse treatment, facilities that exclusively provide substance abuse treatment are not included in this directory. The information about each facility is collected by a survey at the facility level; many data points are collected in the survey about specific treatments and capacities, but the information provided with geographic information in this directory only contained basic characteristics about the type of care, settings, operation, payments accepted, populations served, and others. Altogether, the *National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020* provides a code for 103 different attributes for 235 facilities in Maryland [@samhsaNationalDirectoryMental2020].

The information is provided in a PDF available to download. Since the data is not available in a format that is easily analyzed, the information needed to be extracted and separated into a readable format for analysis. Each facility is listed with a name, address, and code for each attribute associated with that facility. The directory contains a key at the beginning to interpret each code.

The locations and services provided by each facility can demonstrate how access and proximity may be related to the rate of imprisonment in a community. People in jails and prisons are more likely than the general population to suffer from a serious mental health issue, and the carceral system does the bare minimum to provide resources and health care to these individuals while they are incarcerated, let alone before and after their imprisonment [@cloudLifeSupportPublic2014]. The availability of mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment for individuals who may be a risk to the community, as an alternative to imprisonment has more potential to increase public safety and the well-being of communities.

## American Community Survey - Context for Emergency Response

The American Community Survey (ACS) continuously collects data about many different variables to create estimates about the social, economic, and demographic characteristics of different communities. As part of the US Census, these data are available from the census bureau directly. However, for spatial analysis the ACS and Esri, a leader in geographic information system (GIS) software, host spatial data along with various attributes from the survey [@esriACSContextEmergency2020].

The Context for Emergency Response feature layer contains 1475 records for Maryland with 89 variables including the coordinates and shapes required to visually represent attributes geographically at the census tract level. Information about factors that relate to emergency response includes the amount of the population without health insurance, internet access at home, or a personal vehicle. The website hosting the data provides metadata and details about each variable available.

While the importance of these data for this analysis is primarily spatial, the variables about some of these characteristics could be useful for further research to identify other relationships with imprisonment rates of different communities. The spatial data for the census tracts can also be used to determine the distance to different types of mental health facilities.

## The Raw Data

When acquiring observational data collected by another organization, there are limitations on what is available. Often a dataset will include many additional variables in addition to the variables required to answer a research question.

The data from the Prison Policy Initiative was already normalized and estimated in relation to population data from the Census. Because this element was already processed and calculated, there are no missing values. Several outliers exist because of extremely low populations of several census tracts, the imprisonment of only one resident shows as a high proportion when normalized at a rate per 100,000 residents.

The US Census provides hundreds of attributes at the census tract level, however, these are often raw counts of individuals or households for each category. The estimates must be divided by the total counts to calculate the percentage of the population for each census tract for equal comparison. As with many large repositories of data, these datasets are missing some values for various variables. For the useful variables missing values, they are scarce and random; the values can easily be imputed for the important variables by finding the mean within the county of the tract. While outliers may exist in some categories, none were prominent in the variables selected for analysis. The values for each variable are numbers (with the exception of the geographic identifier and the name of the tract), however, they are not always stored as numbers and will need to be properly formatted.

The data about mental health facilities came from the *National Directory of Mental Health Treatment Facilities 2020* as part of the Behavioral Health Services Information System Series [@samhsaNationalDirectoryMental2020]. Since the data is in PDF format, the information needs to be extracted and parsed into an analytic format. Each facility name is accompanied by abbreviated codes that need to be converted into dummy variables. Since this is a comprehensive list of facilities, there are no missing values. The values for facility name and address are strings and do not need to be formatted; however, the address values will be used to obtain the geographic data about their locations on a map and in relation to each census tract.

The spatial data from the ACS is available from the Living Atlas with variables for both the raw counts and the percentages for each attribute as a feature layer for use in ArcGIS Pro [@LivingAtlasWorld]. The data did contain some missing values, but only in three observations and for variables not used for this analysis. Since the data came from a curated source, it was properly formatted as the appropriate data type for both spatial and quantitative analysis.

# Getting an Analytic Dataset

*Write an introduction to the processing of the data.*

*Include an outline of the process including merging, cleaning, manipulating, and aggregating the data.*

## Merging

### Census Tracts

The imprisonment rate data was merged with several tables from the US Census. These were almost all an exact match because each census tract has a unique identifier to link it to the data from other datasets. The exception was for the Urban and Rural data because that was only available from 2010 which had fewer tracts than the 2020 data. The 2010 Urban and Rural census data was joined with 2010 census tract shapefiles in ArcGIS Pro. The spatial data was then apportioned to 2020 tracts based on the area of overlap and weighted by population.

After merging the census data with the imprisonment data, the variables with relevant values were extracted to remove unneeded information regarding annotations and margins of error. The remaining variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.

The merged data from the Prison Policy Initiative and the Census were joined to the ACS tracts in ArcGIS Pro for mapping. Several variables from ACS Context for Emergency Response were added to the merged dataset including percent less than 18 years old, percent 65 Years and over, percent in dependent age groups (under 18 and 65+), percent of households with no vehicle available, percent with a disability, percent with Medicaid coverage, percent with Medicare coverage, percent with no health insurance coverage, percent without a smartphone, and percent without internet access at home. The new variables were renamed with more meaningful names to better reflect the meaning of the values.

### Mental Health Facilities

After extraction from the directory, the dummy variables for mental health facilities in Maryland were renamed with meaningful names, and the addresses for each facility were geocoded in ArcGIS Pro. The geocoded facilities were also joined the newly merged data by spatial proximity. The distance to the closest mental health facility from the edge of each tract was calculated in ArcGIS Pro in feet (as the crow flies) and then converted to miles. The dummy variables for the closest facility were also added to the dataset. This process was repeated for distance to the closest inpatient mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility providing crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins. Using ArcGIS, the total driving distance in miles and minutes was also calculated from the geographic center of each tract to the closest facility in each of these categories.

The complete dataset includes the imprisonment rate values from the Prison Policy Initiative, the selected attributes from the various Census and ACS tables, and the name, address, and dummy variables for the closest mental health facility, the closest inpatient facility, the closest inpatient facility with crisis intervention, and the closest inpatient facility accepting walk-ins, along with the linear distance, driving distance, and driving time to these facilities. These facility attributes were chosen because they represent opportunities for an alternative response to a dangerous situation that may be better resolved with mental health treatment than law enforcement and imprisonment. If individuals who are imprisoned were able to access mental health treatment, and especially inpatient treatment if they may be a threat, in a time of crisis instead of being forced into the stressful and prejudiced criminal justice system, immediate and long-term harm could be avoided.

## Cleaning

Most of the data collected was mostly clean. A few missing values, misformatted values, and outliers needed to be dealt with. By visually analyzing the raw data, sanity checks, and validation, these issues were identified and resolved. In the imprisonment data, some of the total population values were miscalculated and were manually changed by adding the number of imprisoned individuals to the Census population values in Excel.

Census data contains many variables that describe both the attributes and the accuracy of the attribute's values. Many of these attributes were removed altogether, and for others, only the annotation variables were removed, leaving only the relevant variables. Some of the relevant variables were formatted incorrectly and needed to be converted to a numeric format. Several variables contained missing values, and these were imputed with the mean value of that variable for the tract's county. The observations with imputed values are identifiable through a new variable indicating whether they had missing values. The last issue with these data was outliers. Because the imprisonment rate is calculated per 100,000 residents, census tracts with extremely low populations may have an extremely high imprisonment rate, even if only one person is from that tract. To resolve this issue, all tracts with less than 100 total population were excluded. Most of these tracts also had very little land area, and their absence should not impact the results. Three additional tracts were dropped due to missing values for several variables. The three tracts were missing values because they are tracts that only contain corrections facilities, the Baltimore jail, the Maryland correctional training center, and the Maryland state prison

The ACS data also contained some missing values. Three additional tracts were dropped due to missing values for several ACS variables. The three tracts were missing values because they are tracts that only contain correctional facilities, the Baltimore jail, the Maryland correctional training center, and the Maryland state prison. The total number of observations remaining after cleaning the data fell to 1455 census tracts from the original 1475.

## Manipulating

Once the complete dataset had been merged and cleaned, some new variables were created to better represent the data for interpretation. Several of the census variables were converted from raw counts to percentages by dividing the counts by the total and multiplying by 100. These new variables include percent Black, White, and other race; the percent with no high school diploma, only a high school diploma, some college, bachelor's degree, and advanced degree (bachelor's and advanced degree was also combined to have the percent of the population with at least a bachelor's degree); percent under the poverty level; and percent of households who own and rent.

Some of the new percent variables were further converted into dummy variables to represent tracts with either a majority or a value above or below the average. The Black and White ratios were converted into majority dummy variables; the same was done for the homeownership and renters variables. The percent of the tract with a bachelor's degree or higher, percent under poverty, and the unemployment rate were converted to variables to indicate if the value was above or below the mean. Each of these variables was also converted into categorical variables with descriptive labels.

In order to be able to perform analysis at the county level as well as the tract level, the county name was extracted from the tract name variable. The new variable would contain only the name of the county. Because of a formatting error with the apostrophes in some of the county names, some of the values needed to be manually cleaned in Excel.

## Aggregating

To assess the values for each tract in relation to the county they are governed by, the mean values for selected variables were aggregated to the county level. The variables aggregated include the imprisonment rate, median income, and unemployment rate. The following percent variables were also aggregated: percent Black, percent White, percent with a bachelor's degree or higher, percent under the poverty level, percent of residents who own their home, and percent of residents who rent. Once the averages for each county were calculated, the county values were added to the observation for each tract for simpler analysis.

# Analysis of the Data

With all the variables together in one dataset, census tracts and mental health facilities can be compared using a variety of characteristics. Not only is the final dataset free of missing values and unusual census tracts, the analytic dataset has various general characteristics for each tract. Each tract is also linked to the closest mental health facilities offering several specific services. The census tract FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) codes remain in the dataset so additional variable can easily be added. Instead of several datasets in different formats with specific information, the full and unique dataset can now help describe different characteristics and dimensions of high rates of imprisonment.

@tbl-sumMD summarizes some key variables regarding census tract characteristics in the new dataset. The median income across all tracts in Maryland was `r my_dollar(MDsum$Median[3])`, compared to a national median income of \$62,529. The average percentage of Black residents for each tract was `r my_pct(MDsum$Mean[4])`, compared to only 11.2% nationwide. The average rate of individuals on Medicaid in Maryland is lower than the national average at `r my_pct(MDsum$Mean[10])`, compared to 19.9%. As a midatlantic state, tracts in Maryland have a lower percentage of rural housing than the national average by about half, `r my_pct(MDsum$Mean[13])` and 27%, respectively.

The key additional variables calculated and added to the dataset are the distances from each census tract to the closest mental health facility with various characteristics. By identifying various measures of access by distance for each tract, this new dataset may offer unique insights about which communities are most in need of investment in mental health well-being and crisis response. As seen in @tbl-distance, the average distance throughout the state is not extreme; the average travel time to any facility is less than ten minutes, and under thirty minutes to inpatient facilities with crisis intervention or who accept walk-in patients. However, some tracts are up to `r my_number2(MD_Distance$Max[2])`utes away for any mental health facility, `r my_number2(MD_Distance$Max[5])`utes for inpatient facilities, and up to almost three hours for an inpatient facility with crisis intervention. For communities in these areas, the only available response to crisis may be the police, which can lead to more harm to an individual in need of mental health services and those around them.

Of all facilities in Maryland, only `r my_pct1(FacilitiesSum$All[1])`, or `r FacilitiesSum$"Count All"[1]` facilities, offer inpatient care. @tbl-facilities shows the frequency and percentages of various services and payment options. Most of these characteristics will not be covered in-depth in this report; the primary focus will be inpatient facilities with crisis intervention. The larger issue of inadequate mental health outpatient care and cost-prohibitive preventative care is another dimension of the story about the interactions of mental health and imprisonment that could also be explored with these data given the new variables available.

With this complete analytic dataset, visualizing the primary variables, imprisonment rate and inpatient mental health facilities, on a map provides some preliminary context for greater research questions. The map of imprisonment rates in Maryland, shown in @fig-map1, highlights the concentration of high imprisonment in the Baltimore urban area. Since Baltimore is the largest urban area entirely in Maryland, it is not unexpected to see higher rates of imprisonment in the city and surrounding areas. However, the suburbs of Washington, D.C. are also partially in Maryland with comparable population density, but the imprisonment rate for those areas are much lower than the Baltimore suburbs. Though rural areas outside of the two major metropolitan areas seem to have lower rates of imprisonment overall, the southeast peninsula and northwest panhandle seem to have surprisingly higher rates. From this [map](@fig-map1), it seems that these areas are further from inpatient facilities, and the few in those areas may not have sufficient capacity for the large areas they serve.

An initial overall look at the distribution of the tracts and imprisonment rate shows clear and obvious characteristics related to higher rates is race. @fig-MD clearly shows that census tracts that have a majority Black population have, on average, much higher rates of imprisonment. Tracts with less than a majority Black population had an average imprisonment rate of `r round(black_dif$estimate[1], 0)`, and majority Black tracts had an average of `r round(black_dif$estimate[1], 0)`, or `r round(black_dif$estimate[2] - black_dif$estimate[1], 0)` higher than their counterparts. While majority Black tracts had over 100 tracts with an imprisonment rate above 1,000 per 100,000 people, tracts without a majority Black population had only *eight* above 1,000 per 100,000 people, of which half were majority White (see @tbl-outliers).

Expectedly, the common indicators of inequality have a significant relationship with imprisonment rates. Median income, percentage of Black people in the population, percentage of the population with at least a bachelor’s degree, and the unemployment rate are all strongly and significantly related to high imprisonment. As educational attainment and income rise, the expected imprisonment rate falls, and as the percentage of the population that is Black and the unemployment rate rises, so does the expected imprisonment rate. Even when controlling for all of these factors, each has a significant correlation with the rate of imprisonment (see @tbl-regress1).

Since Maryland does contain at least part of two major metropolitan areas, separating out the rural areas can provide insights into how relationships might change outside the city and how to plan and implement policies that target the needs of that type of community. However, @tbl-regress2 shows that the same tract characteristics are still significantly related to imprisonment rates, but with slightly lower numbers.

The crucial addition to this collection of census tract characteristics is the proximity to mental health facilities. As discussed earlier, access to mental health care, and specifically inpatient care when someone is in crisis, is not only an alternative to imprisonment, it may even prevent future harm and repair issues that can lead to criminal behavior. @tbl-regress3 shows little or even the opposite effect overall, but by isolating rural areas the relationship between distance and imprisonment is significant and positive, especially for inpatient facilities with crisis intervention or accepting walk-ins.

Looking at all the models side-by-side in @tbl-regressALL, even controlling for the tract characteristics from @tbl-regress1 and @tbl-regress2, distance to facilities with crisis intervention has a significant relationship with imprisonment. Without accessibility to emergency mental health treatment, people in crisis are more likely to end up arrested or worse if police are the only are the only option to deescalate the situation.

Because urban tracts are overrepresented and more likely to be spatially close to a facility, the relationship is not clear, However, this does not account for capacity at urban facilities. According to the *National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS): 2020*, the average capacity of facilities across Maryland is 44 beds for inpatient clients (slightly lower than the national average of 49) [@samhsaNationalMentalHealth2020]. Even assuming the facilities in Baltimore have a higher capacity than average, it is unlikely the four inpatient facilities within Baltimore City are equipped to adequately provide care to the city’s nearly half a million population. The map from @fig-map1 highlights that Baltimore has the highest concentration of high imprisonment rates in Maryland, but few facilities offering inpatient care. 

## Race and Income

Expected results. A strong correlation between both race and income with imprisonment as well as a strong correlation between race and income themselves. Income as a factor in rural areas that are not majority white and how economic indicators are related to imprisonment and criminal behavior.

## Access to Mental Health Care

While only significant when excluding Baltimore City, proximity to mental health care can not only prevent harmful criminal behavior, it can serve as an alternative for dangerous situations before they become criminal. Mental health accessibility is also important for formerly incarcerated people returning to their communities to heal from the trauma of imprisonment and become capable of reintegrating and supporting their community.

While Baltimore has the highest concentration of imprisonment and proximity to inpatient mental health facilities, there are only four facilities in Baltimore City. Though the exact capacity of these facilities is unknown, the average inpatient capacity for inpatient facilities is \[xxx\], which is not likely to be sufficient to provide the necessary services for all those in Baltimore who would benefit. In addition to other barriers, such as health insurance coverage and transportation to facilities, more research is needed to assess the most effective expansion of service to target the neighborhood most in need.

# Discussion and Conclusion

Discuss limitations, further research, and policy implications.

## Limitations

Data needed about capacity --- Four inpatient facilities may be in close proximity to Baltimore residents, but capacity may be the issue in urban areas.

## Further Research

Lack of health insurance for formerly imprisoned residents as a barrier to access mental health care.

### Datasets:

-   Maryland tracts with nearest facilities and **all** characteristics
-   Maryland tracts with nearest facilities and **select** characteristics
-   Maryland facilities list with **all** characteristics

## Policy Implications

Funding emergency mental health care to divert people in need of health care away from the carceral system both through prevention and treatment.

Many violent conflicts require de-escalation and treatment, not confinement.

Funding and supporting mental health care accessibility can enable people to receive the health care and resources they need instead of becoming entrenched in the endless cycle of incarceration and harm from the Prison Industrial Complex and all its extremities.
